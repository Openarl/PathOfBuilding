crits and non-crits. This has allowed for the following changes:
 * Ignite/shock/freeze calculations now account for the guaranteed chance to inflict on critical strike

    * The existing support for Adder's Touch has been reworked to use the new system

With this update, the program's internal modifier system has been completely overhauled.
On its own this overhaul doesn't change much from the user's perspective, but it has opened the way for some
significant upgrades:
 * The Calcs tab has been rebuilt from the ground up to take advantage of the new modifier system:
    * The various stats and totals are now more clearly divided into sections
	* The individual sections can be minimized to their title bar, so you can hide sections you're not interested in
	* Nearly all of the stats and totals in the new Calcs tab have a breakdown view that appears when you hover over them:
	   * You can click on a stat to pin the breakdown open so you can interact with it
	   * Each breakdown view shows all the information used to calculate that stat, including all modifiers
	   * You can hover over a modifier's source name to show the item's tooltip or passive node's location
	   * Hovering over a modifier source type ('Item', 'Tree', 'Gem' etc) will show the totals from that source type
	* Most modifier totals are no longer displayed in the tab itself, since they can be found in the breakdown views. 
	  The most important ones (such as increased life from tree) are still present, however.
 * Per-stat modifiers are now supported, including, but not limited to, the modifiers from:
    * Shaper's Touch
	* Pillar of the Caged God
	* Dreamfeather
 * Icestorm is now supported! When you have The Whispering Ice equipped, a special socket group will appear
   containing the Icestorm skill. You can select it in the Main Skill dropdown, or view it in the Skills tab.
   You cannot add support gems to this group, but supports from any other group socketed in the staff will
   automatically apply to the Icestorm skill.
 * All other skills granted by items are now supported as well, and will function in the same manner as Icestorm.
   This includes "Curse Enemies with X on Hit" modifiers.
 * Low life/full life conditions are now detected automatically (>=65% life reserved/with CI respectively), 
   but you can still turn them on manually if you need to

Other changes:
 * The various configuration options in the Calcs tab have been moved to a new Configuration tab
	* Moving these into a dedicated tab will provide room for more options to be added in the future
    * The names of many options have been changed to clarify their function
	* Some options now have tooltips that explain aspects of their function
 * Unsupported modifiers are now shown in red instead of white to help convey the fact that they won't work
 * The new class background artworks have been added to the passive skill tree
 * The required level for a build's passive tree is now shown when hovering over the points display
 * The Items tab will now display both source lists (Uniques and Rares) if there's room
 * Support gem compatability is now determined using the same data the game itself uses, and should now be 100% accurate

### 1.1.11 - 2016/10/25
 * Added flat mana to ES armour rare templates

### 1.1.10 - 2016/10/23
 * Added support for the poison-at-max-frenzy modifier on Snakebite

### 1.1.6 - 2016/10/02
 * Fixed bug causing issues with the new jewel attribute totals when a jewel is used multiple times

### 1.1.5 - 2016/10/01
 * Jewel tooltips now show totals for any relevant attributes (Str, Dex, Int) allocated within their radius
    * For example, Eldritch Knowledge shows Intelligence, and Spire of Stone shows Strength
    * For unsupported radius jewels (particularly threshold jewels) all attributes are shown by default
 * Fixed crit chance with Trypanon deviating from 100% under some conditions
 
### 1.1.4 - 2016/09/30
 * The tooltip for socket groups now includes gems which aren't part of any of the group's active skills
    * This includes gems which aren't supported, or are disabled, and any support gems which can't apply to the active skills
 * Made some minor tweaks to the rounding in the damage calculations

### 1.1.3 - 2016/09/26
 * Fixed issue causing certain skill setups to always be added when importing even if that skill is already in the build

### 1.1.0 - 2016/09/20
 * You can now import all character data: passive tree, jewels, skills and items!
    * Character import now has two options:
       * Passive Tree and Jewels: imports the passive skill tree and any jewels socketed into it
	   * Items and Skills: imports all other equipped items, and any skills socketed into them
    * When importing to an existing build:
       * The passive tree will be replaced with the imported one
       * Items (including jewels) will be added to the build, unless the item was added by a previous character import
	      * If you've previously added an item by copying it from ingame, the character import will still add it,
	        so you'll need to delete the old items after the import
	   * Skills will be added if no existing skill matches the new one ('match' meaning the same gems in the same order)
    * The only data that cannot be imported is the bandit choices, as these aren't available from the API
 * Several improvements have been made to the Skills system:
    * You can now specify multiple active gems in a single skill setup (now referred to as a socket group)
    * Hovering over an active gem will highlight the support gems which are applying to it,
	  and hovering over a support gem will highlight the active gems that it applies to
	* The skills system should now be much more accurate at determining which supports can apply to active skill gems
    * Supports granted by an item are now automatically applied to any skills socketed in that item
       * Any such supports that you've added manually will be ignored due to the next change:
    * Multiple copies of support gems are now handled correctly (only the gem with the highest level is used)
 * Modifiers that depend on the absence of enemy status effects should now only apply in effective DPS mode
 * Passive tree search now highlights using a red circle instead of flashing
 * Updated the passive skill tree data
