**NOTES** 

Before submitting your issue, please do a quick search on the Issues page to see if anyone else has already reported the same thing.

Please also prepend your title with a tag describing what it is. Try to keep these uniform with what others have already done. For example:

- [Bug] Damage calculation for Elemental Hit is off when it's exactly 12:04 PM NZST and Venus is in line with Jupiter.
- [Feature Request] POB doesn't make my breakfast for me. Pls fix.

For bug reports, please provide a Pastebin of a build that has been set up to easily re-create or showcase the issue.

Finally, please make sure that your issue is directly related to the _software_ of PoB. If it's not directly related to the software (e.g. "Pls fix my build"), check out places like the [official forums](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum) and [r/PathOfExile](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile).

Once you've read this, feel free to delete the text and describe the issue with as much detail as possible.
