# Path of Building

Welcome to Path of Building, an offline build planner for Path of Exile!
## Features
* Comprehensive offence + defence calculations:
  * Calculate your skill DPS, damage over time, life/mana/ES totals and much more!
  * Can factor in auras, buffs, charges, curses, monster resistances and more, to estimate your effective DPS
  * Also calculates life/mana reservations
  * Shows a summary of character stats in the side bar, as well as a detailed calculations breakdown tab which can show you how the stats were derived
  * Supports all skills and support gems, and most passives and item modifiers
    * Throughout the program, supported modifiers will show in blue and unsupported ones in red
  * Full support for minions
* Passive skill tree planner:
  * Support for jewels including most radius/conversion jewels
  * Features alternate path tracing (mouse over a sequence of nodes while holding shift, then click to allocate them all)
  * Fully integrated with the offence/defence calculations; see exactly how each node will affect your character!
  * Can import PathOfExile.com and PoEPlanner.com passive tree links; links shortened with PoEURL.com also work
* Skill planner:
  * Add any number of main or supporting skills to your build
  * Supporting skills (auras, curses, buffs) can be toggled on and off
  * Automatically applies Socketed Gem modifiers from the item a skill is socketed into
  * Automatically applies support gems granted by items
* Item planner:
  * Add items from in game by copying and pasting them straight into the program!
  * Automatically adds quality to non-corrupted items
  * Fully integrated with the offence/defence calculations; see exactly how much of an upgrade a given item is!
  * Contains a searchable database of all uniques that are currently in game (and some that aren't yet!)
    * You can choose the modifier rolls when you add a unique to your build
    * Includes all league-specific items and legacy variants
  * Features an item crafting system:
    * You can select from any of the game's base item types
	* You can select prefix/suffix modifiers from lists
	* Custom modifiers can be added, with Master and Essence modifiers available
  * Also contains a database of rare item templates:
    * Allows you to create rare items for your build to approximate the gear you will be using
    * Choose which modifiers appear on each item, and the rolls for each modifier, to suit your needs
    * Has templates that should cover the majority of builds (inb4 'why is there no coral amulet?')
* Other features:
  * You can import passive tree, items, and skills from existing characters
  * Share builds with other users by generating a share code
  * Automatic updating; most updates will only take a couple of seconds to apply
